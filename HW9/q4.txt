we have n cities in country or we have n node in free graph. we have some query that give us ai, bi. that means in country shoud be a way from ai to bi, but There is no need for these two cities to be directly adjacent to each other.
and just ai to bi there is no need for bi to ai. we want know coressponding to quereies minimum edges that is nessery for this goal.
in other word in our graph we should have a path from ai to bi and we can not have edge from ai to bi.
the complexity of this problem is that we can optimize number of edges. for exeample wen we have this graph in input:
4 5
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
2 4
 number of nodes are : 4
 number of queries is = 5
	when we put edge from 1 to 2
	and		from 2 to 3
	and 		from 2 to 4
	all queries are possible and tests pass. we can also put an edge from 1 to 4 directly but it is not optimum and tests fales.
	without an aedge from 1 to 4, we can go from 1 to 2, and from 2 to 4 and it is true.
input:
	n m : n = number of cities , m = number of queries
	m line : 
		ai bi
output: minimum edges we need.
